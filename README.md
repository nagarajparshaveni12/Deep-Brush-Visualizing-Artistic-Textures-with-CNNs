# Deep Brush: Visualizing Artistic Textures with CNNs

## Overview
Deep Brush is a deep learning project that leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to visualize and classify artistic textures. By training a pre-trained CNN model on a dataset of artistic images, Deep Brush extracts and highlights distinguishing artistic features, providing insights into different artistic styles. Additionally, Grad-CAM visualizations enhance interpretability by showcasing key areas influencing classification decisions.

## Features
- **Preprocessing Pipeline**: Resizing, normalization, and augmentation of at least 20 artistic images.
- **Pre-trained CNN Model**: Utilizes models like ResNet or EfficientNet for feature extraction and classification.
- **Training & Logging**: Tracks training progress, logs metrics, and saves model checkpoints.
- **Visualization**: Generates Grad-CAM heatmaps to highlight key artistic features.
- **Artistic Insights**: Provides analysis and suggestions based on CNN-generated visual representations.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/deep-brush.git
   cd deep-brush
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Download or prepare a dataset of artistic images.

## Usage
1. **Preprocess the dataset:**
   ```python
   python preprocess.py --input_folder path/to/images --output_folder processed_data
   ```
2. **Train the model:**
   ```python
   python train.py --epochs 10 --batch_size 32 --model resnet
   ```
3. **Generate visualizations and insights:**
   ```python
   python visualize.py --image path/to/image.jpg
   ```

## Dataset
Ensure the dataset consists of at least 20 high-quality artistic images. Preprocessing includes resizing, normalization, and augmentation to enhance training performance.

## Model Training
- The model is trained using TensorFlow or PyTorch.
- Training logs are recorded for progress tracking.
- Model checkpoints are saved to allow resuming or fine-tuning.

## Results & Interpretation
- Classification performance is evaluated using accuracy and loss metrics.
- Grad-CAM visualizations help interpret CNN decisions.
- Artistic insights suggest stylistic elements detected by the model.

## Future Enhancements
- Expand dataset with diverse artistic styles.
- Improve visualization techniques for better interpretability.
- Implement style transfer for enhanced artistic analysis.
